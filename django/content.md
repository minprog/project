# Final Project: Django

## Requirements

Here we list the **requirements** that all submitted projects should accommodate.

- *Functional requirements* define the scope of the project
- *Implementation details* make sure all projects can be graded in the same way and ensure usefulness to a broad audience
- *Process requirements* help us track your progress and help you to get a good grade

A **general requirement** is that your web app may not be based on code you wrote earlier or be similar to the projects you did in this or other courses (it must be a new project) and that you cannot do a project for which the requirements will be set by a third party (the project must be done for this course and not for anyone else).

## Functional requirements<br><small>What it should do</small>

- Your product should provide a solution for a clearly defined human problem and a clearly defined target audience.

- Alternatively, your product may tell an interactive story or allow users to play a game.

- Your product should be reasonably original with regards to apps that are available on the web these days.

- Your product should embody good interaction design practices, to help users easily navigate your site and accomplish their goals.

- Your product's design should fit well in the platform you're using for layout, like Bootstrap.

Note: originality in this case doesn't mean that you must create a totally new idea that has never existed! Originality should likely come from restricting your idea to a specific target audience, to a specific data set, or in some other way. Actually, putting in restrictions can help you make your project fit in a few weeks and at the same time allow you to make it much better and more polished!

## Implementation details<br><small>How it must be implemented</small>

- Your web application must utilize Django, some JavaScript, and quite a bit of SQL.

- Your web application, and especially your database design, must be sufficiently complex, as determined by the course's instructor.

- Your web application's source code must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project to indicate that you wrote it (unless re-using a source file from another project).

- Your web application must be reproducible on another computer by cloning the repository and following instructions in the `README`.

- jQuery may not be used except to use standard functionality from web frameworks like Bootstrap. If you don't know what jQuery is, that's fine!

## Process requirements<br><small>What else you need to do</small>

- You must keep track of your code via git and push your code to GitHub at the end of each day.

- You must keep a process book, as explained later.

- Your web application must be shown running on the final day of the course.

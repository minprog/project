# Wiki: Specification

Complete the implementation of your Wiki encyclopedia. You must fulfil the following requirements:


*   **Entry Page**: Visiting `/wiki/TITLE`, where `TITLE` is the title of an encyclopedia entry, should render a page that displays the contents of that encyclopedia entry.
    *   The view should get the content of the encyclopedia entry by calling the appropriate `util` function.
    *   If an entry is requested that does not exist, the user should be presented with an error page indicating that their requested page was not found.
    *   If the entry does exist, the user should be presented with a page that displays the content of the entry. The title of the page should include the name of the entry.
*   **Index Page**: Update `index.html` such that, instead of merely listing the names of all pages in the encyclopedia, user can click on any entry name to be taken directly to that entry page.
*   **Search**: Allow the user to type a query into the search box in the sidebar to search for an encyclopedia entry.
    *   If the query matches the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user should be redirected to that entry's page.
    *   If the query does not match the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user should instead be taken to a search results page that displays a list of all encyclopedia entries that have the query as a substring. For example, if the search query were `Py`, then `Python` should appear in the search results.
    *   Clicking on any of the entry names on the search results page should take the user to that entry's page.

> Take a look back at the previous exercise [search](/django/projects/0%20search) to recall how to work with forms and query strings.

*   **New Page**: Clicking "Create New Page" in the sidebar should take the user to a page where they can create a new encyclopedia entry.
    *   Users should be able to enter a title for the page and, in a [`textarea`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp), should be able to enter the Markdown content for the page.
    *   Users should be able to click a button to save their new page.
    *   When the page is saved, if an encyclopedia entry already exists with the provided title, the user should be presented with an error message.
    *   Otherwise, the encyclopedia entry should be saved to disk, and the user should be taken to the new entry's page.
*   **Edit Page (extra)**: On each entry page, the user should be able to click a link to be taken to a page where the user can edit that entry's Markdown content in a `textarea`.
    *   The `textarea` should be pre-populated with the existing Markdown content of the page. (i.e., the existing content should be the initial `value` of the `textarea`).
    *   The user should be able to click a button to save the changes made to the entry.
    *   Once the entry is saved, the user should be redirected back to that entry's page.
*   **Random Page (extra)**: Clicking "Random Page" in the sidebar should take user to a random encyclopedia entry.
*   **Markdown to HTML Conversion**: On each entry's page, any Markdown content in the entry file should be converted to HTML before being displayed to the user. You may use the [`python-markdown2`](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) package to perform this conversion, installable via `pip3 install markdown2`.
    *   Challenge for those more comfortable: If you're feeling more comfortable, try implementing the Markdown to HTML conversion without using any external libraries, supporting headings, boldface text, unordered lists, links, and paragraphs. You may find [using regular expressions in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html) helpful.

## Hints

*   By default, when substituting a value in a Django template, Django HTML-escapes the value to avoid outputting unintended HTML. If you want to allow for an HTML string to be outputted, you can do so with the [`safe`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/templates/builtins/#safe) filter (as by adding `|safe` after the variable name you're substituting).

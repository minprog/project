# Screencast

> Het doel van de screencast is de beoordeling van de **functionaliteit** en **interactieontwerp** van jouw project. Onze laatste kans voor doorvragen en jouw laatste kans om de mooiste en beste delen te laten zien.

To make sure that the course's staff doesn't miss any interesting feature of your product when grading, you will make a screencast demonstrating your product's features in a **maximum of 6 minutes**. A screencast is simply a recording of your computer or mobile screen, combined with audio of your voice, explaining how the product works.

Keep in mind: the video does not have to be *perfect*! Most important is that the features of your product are clearly demonstrated.

## Script

Before recording, make a script of what you would like to show. Keep in mind the following requirements:

* Start with an introduction of the goals of your project: who will use it, in what situation and what will they get out of it.

* Show how a user would go about using the product. Show the most common way of going through the application.

* Then, show other ways of navigating the application, special features, exceptions.

* Always show all features: anything that's not in the video does not exist.

Your demo may be narrated in either Dutch or English. Make sure your demonstration does not take longer than 6 minutes. PowerPoint or other tools are not allowed, just show the product.

## Tip

If your application supports something like logins, entering the login info may take a bit too long. Consider hard-coding some username and password on the login screen (in your template), so you can simply press a button to login. Nice demo trick!

### Agent Based Modelling track

For the ABM-track the requirements of the screencast differ: 

* Start with what you modelled, why you think it is relevant and what research questions you wanted to answer.

* Quickly go over all the main components of the model. Explain how your agents work and why you modelled them in this way. Keep in mind that you model in a certain way in order to answer your research question.

* Show the visualisation of your model. Let it run for a bit and point out the dynamics you think are interesting and relevant. You can maybe also change some parameters and show the effect on the model's behavior.

* Finally, show the result of your experiment, and thus answer your research question. The result will usually be a figure that you have generated from running the model over different parameters. You can quickly show the graph and discuss the conclusions you draw from it. 

## Recording

You can use any tool you'd like if you already know how to record screen casts. Don't overdo it, but do make sure your voice is audible and only the relevant parts of the screen are recorded.

### Mac

* Open Quicktime Player.

* Choose File > New Screen Recording.

* Using "options" button next to the "record" button, make sure the correct microphone is selected. Leave the "Show Mouse Clicks" option selected.

* Press "record". You can then drag to select the relevant part of your screen. Please do not record the full screen, but instead resize your browser to a size that your website looks fine, then record only the website.

* To stop recording, use the stop button in the menu bar in the upper-right corner of your screen. After this, you can use Quicktime's editing tools to cut out some parts of your recording.

### Windows

* Download Google Chrome if you do not have it already.

* Click on the icon with the three vertical dots in the right upper corner. Then choose More tools > Extensions > Get more extensions.

* Using the search bar find "Screen Castify" > Add to Chrome.

* Click on the Screen Castify icon, then choose Start recording desktop > Share. From now on everything on your screen will be recorded.

* To end the recording, click the Screen Castify logo and choose Stop.

## Uploading

After recording your video, upload it to Youtube or another video streaming service. Include an embed of your video in the `README.md` on GitHub.
